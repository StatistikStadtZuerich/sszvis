/**
 * Application loop
 *
 * Sets up a self-contained application loop that coordinates state changes and rendering. This
 * reduces common errors, simplifies the setup, and allows us to optimize the render loop.
 *
 * The core functionality is based on [hyperapp](https://github.com/jorgebucaran/hyperapp).
 *
 * INIT returns a Promise containing the state, the render loop will be started once this
 * promise resolves
 *
 * ACTIONS can be of one of the following shapes:
 * - (state, props?) => nextState
 * - (state) => [nextState, ...effects]
 *
 * EFFECTS take the following shape:
 * - [(dispatch, props?) => void, prop?]
 *
 * @example
 * sszvis.app({
 *   init: function () {
 *     return d3.csv(config.data, parseRow).then(function (data) {
 *       return [
 *         {
 *           data: data,
 *           lineData: sszvis.cascade().arrayBy(cAcc, d3.ascending).apply(data),
 *           categories: sszvis.set(data, cAcc),
 *           maxY: d3.max(data, yAcc),
 *           selection: [],
 *         },
 *         sszvis.app.effect("resetDate"),
 *       ];
 *     });
 *   }
 * })
 *
 * @module sszvis/app
