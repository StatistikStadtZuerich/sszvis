# Statistik Stadt ZÃ¼rich Visualization Library

Most users will use the ready-to-use code in `sszvis.js` and `sszvis.css` in the root of this project to get started. If you want to contribute to this library, however, read on.

## Documentation

To read the documentation with all examples, open `index.html` in a browser. You can also read the documentation directly in `docs`. All source code in `sszvis` is documented, too, if you need to know the details.

## Dependencies

This library doesn't have any outside dependencies and doesn't require any special tooling to build. The major build step necessary is to concatenate all Javascript files in `sszvis` into a single file.

To simplify development, we use GNU Make and some helpful libraries on Mac OS X. If you need to develop on another system, check the `Makefile` for the list of files that need to be concatenated.
