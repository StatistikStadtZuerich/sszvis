# Visualization library

> Statistik Stadt ZÃ¼rich uses this library to create visualizations of their statistical data that can be integrated into their content management system.

This library is based on [d3.js](http://www.d3js.org) and is fully interoperable with any [d3 examples](http://bl.ocks.org/) you might find on the Internet. Because it uses the [reusable chart](http://bost.ocks.org/mike/chart/) pattern, any pre-made component you find in this style guide can be replaced with another d3 chart of your choosing.

## Getting started

1. Find an example of a chart that fits your data
2. Download the chart's example code
3. Add the example code to a local webserver like XAMPP
4. View the example and adjust to your liking

## Source code

The source code for every example can be downloaded. In addition, you can have a look at the core library's source here:

* [sszvis.js](sszvis.js)
* [sszvis.css](sszvis.css)
