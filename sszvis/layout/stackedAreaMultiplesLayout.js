/**
 * Stacked Area Multiples Layout
 *
 * This function is used to compute layout parameters for the area multiples chart.
 *
 * @module sszvis/layout/stackedAreaMultiplesLayout
 *
 * @param  {number} height      The available height of the chart
 * @param  {number} num         The number of individual stacks to display
 * @param  {number} pct         the planned-for ratio between the space allotted to each area and the amount of space + area.
 *                              This value is used to compute the baseline positions for the areas, and how much vertical space to leave
 *                              between the areas.
 *
 * @return {object}             An object containing configuration properties for use in laying out the stacked area multiples.
 *                              {
 *                                range:          This is an array of baseline positions, counting from the top of the stack downwards.
 *                                                It should be used to configure a d3.scale.ordinal(). The values passed into the ordinal
 *                                                scale will be given a y-value which descends from the top of the stack, so that the resulting
 *                                                scale will match the organization scheme of sszvis.stackedArea. Use the ordinal scale to
 *                                                configure the sszvis.stackedAreaMultiples component.
 *                                bandHeight:     The height of each multiples band. This can be used to configure the within-area y-scale.
 *                                                This height represents the height of the y-axis of the individual area multiple.
 *                                padHeight:      This is the amount of vertical padding between each area multiple.
 *                              }
